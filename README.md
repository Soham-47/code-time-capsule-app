# Code Time Capsule

A digital platform where users can encapsulate code (snippets, scripts, or full projects) with a scheduled unlock date, optionally sharing it with others once unlocked.

## Features

- üîí **Secure Encryption**: Client-side AES-256 encryption keeps your code private until unlock date
- üìÖ **Time-Based Unlocking**: Set a future date for your code to become accessible
- üë• **Flexible Sharing**: Choose between private, shared, or public access upon unlocking
- üíª **Syntax Highlighting**: Support for multiple programming languages
- üîê **Passphrase Protection**: Access your capsule with a memorable passphrase
- üåê **Public Feed**: Browse and learn from unlocked public capsules

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes, Prisma ORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js with multiple providers (credentials, GitHub, Google)
- **Code Editor**: Monaco Editor (same as VS Code)
- **Encryption**: CryptoJS (AES-256)
